<h1>CP Quiz #1</h1>

<h2>Levels of Measurement</h2>

<p>There are a total of three different levels of measurement.</p>

<h3>Nominal Data(Categorical Variable + Discrete)</h3>

<p>This data classifies into one group or another.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Cannot say that </strong>One response is higher/lower than another

		<ul>
			<li>Basically there is no relationship between the different possibilities</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Examples: Sex, Race, Insurance Status</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ordinal Data(Discrete)</h3>

<p>Collected in ways that has an inherent ranking/ordering, but do not know how much more/less one is -&gt; just that it is more/less</p>

<ul>
	<li>Examples: Education level, School Grades, Health Status, finishing position in a race</li>
</ul>

<h3>Interval and Ration Data(Continuous or Discrete)</h3>

<p>This is <strong>ordered data</strong> with a constant scale.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Interval data has “no natural zero”</li>
	<li>Example: Temperature(Interval Data), Birth weight</li>
</ul>

<h4>Natural Zero</h4>

<ul>
	<li>A true zero measurement value, like height.</li>
	<li>But year/temperature do not have a natural zero as the choice of a 0 is arbitrary(like freezing point of water or the year 0)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Operationalization</h3>

<p>The process in order to turn a vague concept into a precise measurement.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Theoretical Construct:</strong> The item we are trying to take a measurement of</li>
	<li><strong>A Measure:</strong> refers to the method or tool used to make observations

		<ul>
			<li>Such as a question in a survey or a behavioral observation</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li><strong>Variable:</strong> The actual data we utilize within our data sets.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reliability</h3>

<p>Tells you how precisely you are measuring something while validity means how accurate the measure is.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Refers to the <strong>repeatability or consistency</strong> of the measurement.</li>
	<li>Example: Using a bathroom scale to measure ones weight

		<ul>
			<li>The scale will return the same weight constantly making it <strong>RELIABLE</strong> but it could be off by a certain number(inaccurate/invalid).</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>Test-Retest Reliability</h4>

<p>Test the consistency over a time period, will we get the same measurement at a later date.</p>

<h4>Inter-Rater Reliability</h4>

<p>The consistency across people, so if this measurement is repeated over to a different person is it the same answer.</p>

<h4>Parallel forms Reliability</h4>

<p>The consistency across theoretically equivalent measurements, across multiple bathroom scales is it the same.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Descriptive statistics is to summaries what we know while inferential statistics is to learn what we do not know from what we know</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Samples &amp; Population</h2>

<h3>Sampling Method</h3>

<p>The way/procedure a sample is selected from a population.</p>

<h4>Simple Random Sampling</h4>

<p>The procedure where every member within the population has the <strong>same</strong> chance of being selected.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Without replacement</em> means removing the sample from the population so they would not repeat.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Most psychology experiments tend to be sampling without replacement because the same person is not allowed to participate in the experiment twice</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Stratified Sampling</h4>

<p>The procedure where you chose a random sample from every single one of the strata(sub-populations).</p>

<ul>
	<li>Example: non-schizophrenic and schizophrenic

		<ul>
			<li>known as <strong>oversampling</strong> as a rare group is over-represented through sampling</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>Snowball Sampling</h4>

<p>Basically gain contacts/sampling by asking the initial sample for more people to participate.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Useful for a hard to access population</li>
</ul>

<h4>Convenience Sampling</h4>

<p>Choose a convenient sample for the research and generally not random</p>

<ul>
	<li>Snowball Sampling is one version of this.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Population Parameters </h3>

<p>Known as the <strong>characteristics of the entire population</strong>, such as the population mean and population standard deviation.</p>

<h3>Sample Statistics</h3>

<p>These are the actual properties from a collected data set such as the sample mean and sample standard deviation.</p>
